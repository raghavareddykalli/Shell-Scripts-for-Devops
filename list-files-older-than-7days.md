# **Shell script to find and ist the log files older than 7 days in the /var/log folder**

```
find /var/log -type f -name *.log -mtime +7 -exec ls -lh {} \;
```

## **Detailed Explanation**

**üîç Breakdown of the command:**

```find```: The Linux command to search for files in a directory hierarchy.

```/var/log```: The target directory that contains log files.

```-type f```: Limits the search to files (not directories). Use d to search directories

```-name *.log```: Search for files ending with .log 

```-mtime +7```: Filters files modified more than 7 days ago.

                 +7 means strictly older than 7 days.

                 -7 would mean newer than 7 days.
